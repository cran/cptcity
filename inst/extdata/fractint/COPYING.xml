Copyright Information:
======================

Some parts of the source are from the public domain and are not
copyrighted.

Some parts of the source bear explicit copyright notices from the
author and are subject to the conditions listed there by the author.

The remainder of the source (not already public domain, no explicit
author's copyright notice) is Copyright 1990, 1991 by the Stone Soup Group
(a loosely associated and ever-growing group of fanatic programmers).

The source code may be copied freely and may be used in other programs
under the following conditions:
  It may not be used in a commercial program which produces fractal images.
  Please credit the author (in general, credit Fractint and the Stone Soup
  Group) as the source of the code.


Distribution of modified versions of Fractint:
==============================================

If you enhance Fractint and want to distribute the results to others, the
preferred approach is to join the Stone Soup Group - send us your
enhancements and get your name in lights in future versions of Fractint.

We prefer that a modified Fractint executable program not be distributed to
others, but understand that you might want to give copies to friends.  This
is permitted, under the following conditions:
  o The modified executable has a different name than "fractint.exe".
  o The distribution includes a full unmodified copy of the corresponding
    original version of fraint.exe.  (The easiest way is to copy fraint.exe
    to yournew.exe, then "pkzip -a fraint.exe newfract.exe" to add your
    version, and perhaps add a read.me file to describe it.)
  o The heading displayed by the modified program clearly indicates that
    it is a non-standard release.  E.g. you might change the heading to
    say "Non-standard Fractint, Modified by John Doe".
  o All author credits and distribution information in the online help
    are unchanged (adding lines for your work is of course ok.)

The source code for a modified version of Fractint may not be distributed.
(This is because we don't want any chance of confusion over which version
of a source file is the official release.)
