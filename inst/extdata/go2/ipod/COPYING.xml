      We hope you like them and as always you're free to use them 
      however you wish, as long as that's OK with Apple. Is that 
      OK with you, Steve?

      If you like this and any of our other icon work we always 
      appreciate a link back. If you really like this and our other 
      icons, please consider giving us a little monetary incentive 
      for us to produce another set in the near future. You'll be 
      glad you did, we promise!
